\section{Problem Description}

On IMDB every day reviews are written about movies and a grade is provided with it.
All this data gives us the opportunity to train a classifier with the goal to predict if a review is positive or negative.
The used data set, created by Maas \etal \cite{Maas:2011}, consists of 50.000 reviews equally divided between positive and negative reviews. 
This again is divided in a training and test set, both containing an equal number of positive and negative reviews.

Our goal for this project is to do the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Preprocess the data, using different natural language processing techniques (\eg lemmatizing);
\item Determine which features to use (\eg tf-idf, n-grams);
\item Find the best classifier suitable for classifing text;
\item Evaluate the trained classifier.
\end{itemize}
